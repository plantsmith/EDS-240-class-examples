# Example 1:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

1.  Copy the following code into your week3-discussion.qmd file and add code chunk options that: render the output (i.e. plot), but not the code suppress any warnings or messages
2.  Add alt text using the fig-alt: code chunk option
3.  “Inspect” your plot (right click \> Inspect) to verify that the alt attribute and text is added to the HTML

```{r}
#| eval: true # evaluate this code block (dont skip over it, run this code)
#| echo: false # show output, dont show code
#| message: false #hides any messages
#| warning: false
#| fig-cap: "histogram"
#| fig-alt: " A histogram of penguin body masses where Gentoo penguins have body masses that are about 2000g larger than Adelie and Chinstrap penguins."


ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, 
                 position = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(x = "Body mass (g)",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Penguin body masses")
```

# Example 2:

1.  Download this viz (right click \> Save Image As… \> save to your class repo)
2.  Embed the viz in week3-discussion.qmd using Markdown syntax and add alt text

![monthly](nyt-monthly-temp.png)(fig-alt = 'A dot plot of monthly global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average, where monthly global temperatures are increasing over time. Nearly every month since the mid-1970s is warmer than the 20th-century average, with 12 record-breaking hot months occurring between 2015-2023.')

# Example 3:

<img src="biodiversity-image.png" alt="A heatmap of global species observations where the highest concentration of observations occur in high-income countries, particularly in the USA and European nations." width="700px"/>
